# Haptic-BOS1921 Dev Kit - Open Source PCB Design

Welcome to the open-source development kit for the **BOS1921 Haptic Driver**! This repository contains all the necessary files and resources to build your own breakout board for the **BOS1921 piezo haptic driver** IC from Boréas Technologies.

The BOS1921 is an ultra-low-power piezo driver with advanced sensing capabilities, making it ideal for applications requiring precise haptic feedback, such as trackpads, smartphones, and other interactive devices.

## Features of the Haptic-BOS1921 Dev Kit:
- **190V peak-to-peak piezo haptic driver** using Boréas' patented CapDrive™ technology.
- **Ultra-low power consumption** for extended use in battery-powered devices.
- **Advanced piezo sensing** to support precise haptic feedback and control.
- **I2C/I3C interface support** for easy integration into your existing projects.
- **Small form factor**, suitable for compact devices.
